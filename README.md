# AI Football Tipster ⚽️🔮

**AI Football Tipster** is a sophisticated, AI-powered web application that provides detailed predictions and analyses for football matches. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini Pro model to deliver insights far beyond simple win/loss predictions, including key stats, tactical breakdowns, and data-driven betting tips.

## ✨ Core Features

-   **🤖 AI-Powered Predictions**: Utilizes Google's Gemini Pro model to generate nuanced match predictions.
-   **📊 Detailed Breakdowns**: Each prediction includes a full analysis, confidence levels, recent form (W/D/L), and head-to-head statistics.
-   **📈 Analyst's Picks**: Suggests "Best Bets" for various markets like Match Winner and Over/Under Goals, complete with confidence percentages.
-   **⚡️ Live Scores**: Features a real-time sidebar with live scores from major matches around the world, powered by TheSportsDB API.
-   **🗂️ Prediction History**: All predictions are saved to a Supabase database, allowing users to track a history of the AI's performance.
-   **🎯 Accuracy Tracking**: Automatically calculates and displays the historical accuracy of winning predictions.
-   ** Tally System**: Avoids duplicate predictions by tallying requests for the same match, saving API costs and showing popular predictions.
-   ** toggler Dark & Light Mode**: A sleek, user-friendly theme toggle for comfortable viewing in any lighting.
-   ** autocomplete Team Autocomplete**: An intuitive search that suggests team names as you type.
-   **🔒 Secure & Scalable**: Built with a serverless architecture using Netlify Functions, ensuring API keys and sensitive logic are never exposed on the frontend.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend**: Netlify Functions (Serverless Node.js)
-   **AI Model**: Google Gemini Pro
-   **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
-   **Live Scores API**: TheSportsDB
-   **Hosting**: Netlify

## ⚙️ How It Works

The application follows a secure, serverless workflow:

1.  **User Input**: The user enters two team names and selects a match category (Men's/Women's) on the React frontend.
2.  **Secure API Call**: The request is sent to a secure Netlify Function (`/api/gemini-predict`).
3.  **Cache Check**: The function first checks the Supabase database for a recent prediction (within 24 hours) for the same match.
    -   **If found**, it increments a `tally` counter on the existing record and immediately returns the cached data.
    -   **If not found**, it proceeds to the next step.
4.  **AI Analysis**: The function calls the Gemini Pro API with a detailed prompt and a required JSON schema.
5.  **Structured Response**: Gemini analyzes the match and returns a structured JSON object containing the full prediction, stats, and analysis.
6.  **Database Storage**: The Netlify Function then saves this complete prediction to the Supabase database with a starting tally of 1.
7.  **Display Results**: The new or cached record from the database is returned to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## 🚀 Getting Started (For Developers)

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-football-tipster.git
cd ai-football-tipster
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

This project uses Netlify Functions, which rely on environment variables. You will need API keys from Google, Supabase, and TheSportsDB.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```
# .env

# Google Gemini API Key
# Get it from Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"

# Supabase Project Credentials
# Get them from your Supabase project settings -> API
# IMPORTANT: Use the variable name SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL, not SUPABASE_URL.
SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL="your_supabase_project_url"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_supabase_public_anon_key"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_supabase_service_role_key"

# TheSportsDB API Key for Live Scores
# Get it from: https://www.thesportsdb.com/user_reg.php
THESPORTSDB_API_KEY="your_thesportsdb_api_key"
```

### 4. Set Up Supabase Database

1.  Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
2.  Go to the "SQL Editor" section.
3.  Run the following SQL script to create the `predictions` table:

```sql
-- Create the 'predictions' table
CREATE TABLE public.predictions (
    id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    team_a character varying NOT NULL,
    team_b character varying NOT NULL,
    match_category character varying NOT NULL DEFAULT 'men'::character varying,
    prediction_data jsonb,
    status character varying DEFAULT 'pending'::character varying,
    tally integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    CONSTRAINT predictions_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
    CONSTRAINT predictions_status_check CHECK (((status)::text = ANY ((ARRAY['pending'::character varying, 'won'::character varying, 'lost'::character varying])::text[])))
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for the table
ALTER TABLE public.predictions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy to allow public read access (using the anon key)
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for all users"
ON public.predictions
FOR SELECT
USING (true);

-- Note: Inserts and updates are handled by the backend functions
-- using the SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, which bypasses RLS. This setup
-- ensures that the public can read data, but only the secure
-- backend can write or modify it.
```

4.  **Important: Refresh the Schema Cache**
    After creating the table, you must tell Supabase to recognize the new schema.
    - Go to the **API Docs** section in your Supabase project dashboard.
    - Click on `predictions` in the sidebar.
    - At the top of the page, you'll see a button to **Reload schema**. Click it.
    - This step is critical to prevent "column not found" errors when the app tries to access new columns like `tally`.

### 5. Run the Project Locally

The project is configured to run with the Netlify CLI, which serves the frontend and the serverless functions together.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and the Netlify Functions server. Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).
